Today:

Faced with ssh-problem when pushing from local machine to GitHub

Solved problem by adding `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub` under `ssh` folder in the
local machine

Changed git user name and email by setting :
        `git config --global user.name'name'` and
        `git config --global user.email'useremail@users.noreply.github.com`
